            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Static web pages which usually consists of a simple layout from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is hypertext markup language, which defines the contents of the page like this text that's being read. CSS is the design for the page which is linked into the HTML document. That's how you see the picture next to this text. </p>
            <p class="lead">Static sites are consistent as every time someone requests the page and when requested, it comes from the web server to the web browser. The request is called an HTTP, hypertext transfer protocol, request, which allows the server know which file is being called upon. It starts from either a link or typing the address, which sends a HTTP requests to the web server, and then the server sends a HTTP response to the web browser which requested it. </p>
            <p class="lead">Theming is the main component for creating static sites since it allows flexibility and consistency for each page. Though there are only a set number of pages as it requires updating the code which then gets re-uploaded.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="topic2">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #2
                <span class="text-muted">Dyanamic Trio</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Dynamic web pages are processed differently than static web pages since they require a database and application server in order to be received to your web browser. It works by sending an HTTP request to the web server which is then processed by the application server. Once identified, it retrieves the requested information from the database server which is sent to the application server to then be sent to the web server which is then sent back to your browser as an HTML through a HTTP response.</p>
            <p class="lead">The information that gets processed and identified through the application server is called the server-side processing, as it is on the server part of the client-side relationship. The whole process beginning from the insertion of a URL to the HTTP response is called round trip, as it goes through two to three servers and then back.</p>
            <p class="lead">A few examples of dynamic sites are Netflix and Amazon that could end up being different every time they are requested. The content becomes personalized as it looks at historical content and then finds similarity options. It becomes quicker to use dynamic web pages as they can be built on the fly as opposed to static pages. This relates to me as I would one day like to create a database with a culmination of stories which should be created through a dynamic site for more personlization or even to have an easier structure/organization for the information.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">J-Who?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">JavaScript, JS, assists in client-side processing, which is used for data validation, image swap/rollovers, and slideshows. JS is a scripting language to program the behavior of the page. It allows for a quicker response for the client allowing the client to switch through images or get information approved or disapproved. This only work as all the information, whether data, photos or videos, is loaded onto the website cache, collection of items stored in hidden or inaccessible place.</p>
            <p class="lead">JavaScript processing functions when a user requests the web page, which then sends an HTTP request to the web server and then receives an HTTP response from the web server with HTML and JavaScript files. A JavaScript engine is used to ease the processing and allow the application to run faster so the code is executed in the web browser.jQuery is a popular library that is used to contain code to do features like data validation, image rollovers, image swaps and more.</p>
            <p class="lead">This relates to the class overall as we will have to construct a weather app which will have to have client-side processing so information can be easily and quickly loaded upon request. On top of that, it relates to me as this would relate to my goals as being a non-profit IT developer as I would like to make that people can sort through the website as quickly as possible.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">HTML5</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The primary HTML5 semantic elements are header, main, section, article, aside, nav, figure, and footer. The header is the usually the top of the page, so in this case it would be where it says the title "Lesson 2 Highlights". The main is the center content of the page and can only appear once. In this case it would be the culmination of all the highlights. The section is the part of the document or page, that is not the main content, which in this case is each individual highlight portion. The article is the content or article of the section, so in this case this paragraph in this section. The aside is the sidebar that is related to the information on the page, so would be the FSU links when you are in a specific part of the site like Office of National Fellowships. The nav is the part of the site that has links to placeholders or other sites. The figure is the an video, table, image or other component like the demonstration of HTML5 semantic elements to the left of this paragraph. The footer is usually the bottom of the page.</p>
            <p class="lead">This relates to the class as these are essential elements to a web page, especially when it comes to constructing so to know where each component should be placed and what could be missing, if anything is. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Intranet and Extranets are both applications used to share information. Intranets are used by members or employees, in order to spread and receive forms, manuals, reports, schedules and more to other employees or members. On the other hand, extranets are used by select business partners, in order to share financial information, inventory, and product details with the business' partners. While it could be used for corporate social media or contact and even allow peer collaboration. These private networks are what make up the overall world wide web and are facets of it as it is a private network to communicate for efficiently, privately and securely.</p>
            <p class="lead">In the class, we learned about this as a way to decipher the different networks that a company may use, especially when pertaining to how messages are sent through the web. With firewalls, they protect unauthorized personnel to access the information within a private network, as the previously stated ones. It will only allow specific requests and responses to be sent and received so that the server, on the client side, could be protected at all costs. This is important for me, as I learn more about network security and how to manage data protection, especially when it concerns copyright infringement.</p>
